Please note that this project has adopted a Code of Conduct. I expect all contributors to adhere to it. The Code of Conduct can be found in the [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) file.

## Naming Conventions

- Follow the official Go language naming conventions as much as possible.
- Use descriptive and meaningful names for variables, functions, and types.
- Use camelCase for variable and function names (e.g., `myVariable`, `myFunction`).
- Use PascalCase for type and struct names (e.g., `MyType`, `MyStruct`).
- Avoid using single-letter variable names unless they are used as iterators (e.g., `i`, `j`, `k`).

## Coding Style

- Follow the official Go language formatting guidelines by using the `gofmt` tool or an editor plugin that automatically formats the code.
- Use tabs for indentation with a tab width of 4 spaces.
